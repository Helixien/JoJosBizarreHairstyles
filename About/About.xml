	<description>Good grief, let me tell you about this incredible mod right here! With this mod, you can now give your colonists the iconic hairstyles from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and turn them into stylish stand users (or psycasters, whatever!). From my signature hat hair to (soon) Giorno's golden locks, the options are endless. Your colonists will not only look fabulous but will also grant them more willpower to aid them in their survival. So why settle for boring, mundane hairstyles when you can add some Joestar flair to your Rimworld game? It's time to say goodbye to ordinary and hello to fabulous!</description>
